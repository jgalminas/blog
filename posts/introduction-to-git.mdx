## What is Git?

Git is a version control system and it is the most popular out there because it is incredibly fast, highly scalable, open source and also free. A version control 
system is simply a piece of software that records changes made in code and stores them in a database called repository. This allows us to view the changes made 
over time and revert to them if needed. Git provides an effortless way of creating sub-versions (branches) of a project, adding new code and merging to the 
main code base later on which makes adding new features and colaborating with other developers a breeze.

## How to use Git

Once <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">installed</a>, Git can be used in two ways — via a graphical user interface such as GitHub desktop client or the 
command-line which is, in my opinion, the best way to use Git, especially if you are new to it. Learning to work with the command-line will teach you the ins and 
outs of Git while also making it rather convenient as most code editors have a command-line terminal built into them so there is no need for switching between 
applications. It's also worth mentioning that GUI clients typically only support a subset of Git features — another reason to use command-line over GUI.

### Changes in Git repository

First things first it's important to understand that Git has four main states to describe each file in a repository:

* <b>Untracked:</b> <em>These are files that are new to to the folder and are not currently tracked by the repository</em>
* <b>Unmodified:</b> <em>These are files that are being tracked, but haven't been modified yet</em>
* <b>Modified:</b> <em>These are files that are being tracked, have been modified, but have not been staged yet</em>
* <b>Staged:</b> <em>These are files that are being tracked and to be commited</em>

You can see the state of each file in your repository by executing the following command

<CodeBlock lineNum={false} language="shell" text="git status"/>

### Initialising a local repository

A new Git repository can be created by simply navigating to the root of the folder in command-line and executing the following command
<CodeBlock lineNum={false} language="shell" text="git init -b <branch name>"/>

The <em><b> {`-b <branch name>`} </b></em> part can be ommited if you just wish to use the default initial branch name which is <em><b> "master" </b></em> unless 
changed in the Git config.

That's all it takes to create a local Git repository! Now if you already have some files created they can be staged using

<CodeBlock lineNum={false} language="shell" text="git add <file name>"/>

or

<CodeBlock lineNum={false} language="shell" text="git add ."/>

to add all files. Once the files are staged you can commit them using

<CodeBlock lineNum={false} language="shell" text="git commit -m <message>"/>

### Pushing the local repository to Github

In order to push your local repository to Github you need to first have a remote respository created or create one using Github's command-line interface. Then
you can push your local files to Github in just a few commands.

Start with linking the remote repository to the local one
<CodeBlock lineNum={false} language="shell" text="git remote add origin <remote repository url>"/>

The remote repository url must be a complete url to the repository on GitHub, for example, <em><b> https://github.com/johndoe/awesomerepo.git </b></em>

You can verify this by executing

<CodeBlock lineNum={false} language="shell" text="git remote -v"/>

and now all that is left is to push the changes to Github.

<CodeBlock lineNum={false} language="shell" text="git push origin <branch name>"/>

And voilà! Your local repository is now stored online!

### Cloning an existing respository

If you wish to clone a project to a local repository that you can work on, this can be done via the following command

<CodeBlock lineNum={false} language="shell" text="git clone <remote repository url>"/>

### Seeing commit history

In order to see what commits have been made in a repository the following command can be used

<CodeBlock lineNum={false} language="shell" text="git log"/>

The results will be displayed in reverse chronological order. A variety of additional options can be applied to get a narrowed down list. This can be very helpful
for larger projects with thousands of commits. A comprehensive guide on how to use <b><em> git log </em></b> can be found 
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Undoing stuff

This is where things can get a little tricky and you should really understand what you are doing as it is possible to lose some data if you do it wrong.

#### Amending a commit

If you just commited some files and realised that you forgot to add a message or would like to change it you can do this by executing the following

<CodeBlock lineNum={false} language="shell" text="git commit --amend -m <new message>"/>

What if you just commited but forgot to add some files? You can do this

<CodeBlock lineNum={false} language="shell" text="git add <file name>
git commit --amend"/>

<HighlightedMessage color="grey" text="
However, it is important to note that when you amend a commit you aren't just editing the contents you are replacing it with a whole new commit, that's why you
should not amend anything that has already been pushed to the remote repository as that will cause issues for your colaborators.
"/>

#### Unstaging a file

If you wish to unstage a file you can use the following command

<CodeBlock lineNum={false} language="shell" text="git restore --staged <file name>"/>

#### Unmodifying a file

Lets say you have done some work and modified a file, but you don't want the changes anymore. Well, you can unmodify the file with

<CodeBlock lineNum={false} language="shell" text="git restore <file name>"/>

<HighlightedMessage text="
Very important to note that this is a dangerous command and the work that you remove will be gone forever, because the file will be replaced with the last
staged or commited version.
"/>

### Branching

#### What is branching?

Branching is a way for you to split from the main production branch, develop, test and implement new code that doesn't interfere with it. Once you have developed an
additional feature that you are happy with you can easily merge the branch to the main line. It also allows you to work on more than one area of the project at 
the time, which useful because it allows colaboration. If you want to learn exactly how branching works, you can read more 
about it <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### Creating branches

You can create branches via the following command

<CodeBlock lineNum={false} language="shell" text="git branch <branch name>"/>

Most often you will want to create and switch to a branch at the same time which you can do with

<CodeBlock lineNum={false} language="shell" text="git checkout -b <branch name>"/>

#### Switching between branches

To simply switch between branches you can use

<CodeBlock lineNum={false} language="shell" text="git checkout <branch name>"/>

#### Merging branches

Once you have written some code in your brand new branch you will want to merge to the main branch. Typically if you are contributing to an open-source project or
are working in a team and wanted to merge to the main branch you would
open a pull request, where the code is reviewed by someone else and then merged together so all you have to do is push the local branch to the remote repository
and open a pull request there. However, you can also merge branches locally by navigating to your main branch and using the following command

<CodeBlock lineNum={false} language="shell" text="git branch <branch you want to merge>"/>

Once merged you can simply push the main branch to the remote repository.

#### Merge conflicts

Now merging branches wont always be a smooth process, this can be a slightly tricky sometimes. For example, if the same part of a file has been changed in both
of the branches you're trying to merge git will halt the process and make you manually resolve the conflict by picking which changes you want to keep. Once you
have resolved the conflit you will need to commit the merge by executing

<CodeBlock lineNum={false} language="shell" text="git commit"/>

#### Deleting branches

Once you have merged the branch with the main branch you can delete it by using

<CodeBlock lineNum={false} language="shell" text="git branch -d <branch name>"/>

## Conclusion

And that is all, keep in mind this article covers only the most common functionality of Git just to get you started with version control. There is a lot more that 
Git offers which you can learn about on their <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2" target="_blank">website</a>.

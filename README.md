# Personal Blog Website

## 💡 Background 

I am quite keen and always want to learn new things and I have noticed that I learn mutch better if I can effectively
explain what I am learning about. So I thought it would be a good idea to create a blog where I can share my experience
as I am learning and discovering new things. This way I have everything accessible on the web and who knows it might 
also help somebody out there, which is always great 😊!

## ✨ Features
Here is what the website currently includes:

✅ Ability to subscribe to a newsletter <br>
✅ Get related article recommendations based on currently accessed article <br>
✅ Ability to switch between dark and light mode <br>
✅ Ability to have interactive components inside articles

## ⚙️ Project Structure

I built this blog using Next.js. Utilising this incredible framework I was able to quickly build this page using
static site generation for incredible performance 🔥 and great search engine optimisation. Articles are written in MDX — a
superset of Markdown which allows the use of React components inside Markdown pages (how awesome is that?). During build 
time the content is parsed into HTML where Next.js generatates it into pages.

I quite like the minimalist approach when it comes to design so I decided to use custom CSS throughout the page with
the help of SASS to keep all neat and well structured!

### 🔧 Tools
